**Project 1:** **AI-Powered Requirements Extraction Tool**

Business Problem: Manual requirements gathering from stakeholder interviews and documents is time- consuming and prone to missing implicit needs.

AI Solution Implementation:
1. Data Collection
Gather 20-30 sample stakeholder interview transcripts (create realistic examples or use public datasets)
Collect requirements documents from past projects (sanitized/anonymized)
2. AI Model Development
Use NLP models (GPT-4 API or open-source alternatives like BERT) to extract functional and non-functional requirements
Implement entity recognition to identify stakeholders, systems, and dependencies
Create a classification model to categorize requirements (functional, non-functional, constraints)
3. Process Improvement Metrics
Time reduction: 60% faster requirements extraction
Completeness: 25% more requirements identified through AI pattern recognition Consistency: Standardized requirement format across all documents

Skills Demonstrated: NLP, Requirements Engineering, Process Automation, Python, API Integration
